# EnglishStressStatistics
Here you can find a series of tools for doing analysis of the English stress system using the CMU pronouncing dictionary.

You can get the pronouncing dictionary directly from the source at:
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Bruce Hayes also has his own, somewhat cleaned-up version, available on this page:
http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/BLICK/CMUDictionaryEditedWithCELEXFrequenciesPublicVersion2.xls

Included here are a series of python scripts which can be used to transform CMU into a highly-annotated file useful for doing statistics on.
