# EnglishStressStatistics
Here you can find a series of tools for doing analysis of the English stress system using the CMU pronouncing dictionary.

You can get the pronouncing dictionary directly from the source at:
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Bruce Hayes also has his own, somewhat cleaned-up version, available on this page:
http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/BLICK/CMUDictionaryEditedWithCELEXFrequenciesPublicVersion2.xls

At the moment, you can see my annotated cmu: newCMU.txt, and use the R script corpusAnalysis.R to analyze it in R.  Also see the R script for explanations of the column names if they are opaque

Check back for updates!  Soon there will also be python scripts that can get you all the way from the raw CMU to an annotated file like newCMU.txt
